# GeoPySpark Presentation and Demo for GeoPySpark 2018

This repo contains the presentation and demo given on
[GeoPySpark](https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark) at
[GeoPython 2018](http://2018.geopython.net) in a Jupyter Notebook.
The demo of GeoPySpark shows how to create a cost distance layer of
the continental United States using a friction surface that takes the
following into consideration: roads, trails and paths, waterways,
elevation, and land cover.


Bellow shows the data source for each of these factors:

  - Roads, trails, paths, and waterways:
    [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org)
  - Elevation: [The National Elevation
    Dataset](https://nationalmap.gov/elevation.html)
  - Land cover: [National Land Cover Dataset](https://www.mrlc.gov)

Unfortunately, it's not possible to run this demo due to the
permissions needed to access the data. If you wish to run something
similar, however, then this notebook will provide a good resource. If you have any questions or need help, please feel free to let us know on our [gitter channel](https://gitter.im/geotrellis/geotrellis).
